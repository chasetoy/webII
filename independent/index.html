			<p class="tooltip">jQuery, at its core, is a <a href="#" title="Document Object Module">DOM</a> manipulation library. The DOM is a tree-structure representation of all the elements of a Web page and jQuery simplifies the syntax for finding, selecting, and manipulating these DOM elements. For example, jQuery can be used for finding an element in the document with a certain property (e.g. all elements with an h1 tag), changing one or more of its attributes (e.g. color, visibility), or making it respond to an event (e.g. a mouse click). jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select DOM elements, create animations, handle events, and develop Ajax applications. jQuery also provides capabilities for developers to create plug-ins on top of the JavaScript library. </p>

			<p class="tooltip">jQuery is run using a javascript file which calls different <a href="#" title="a named procedure that performs a distinct service. The language statement that requests the function is called a function call.">function(s)</a> thats bring the website to life, such as these tooltips being used on this page. The function can be ran in two different ways. One being that the function is loaded as the page is which depending on the size of the page, can take some time. Or, the function can be loaded once the static web page has been fully loaded. This function is called using the<a href="#" title="window.onload=function;"> "onload"</a> function call. The jQuery library is a single JavaScript file containing all of its common DOM, event, effects, and Ajax functions. It can be included within a Web page by linking to a local copy or to one of the many copies available from public servers. jQuery has a content delivery network (CDN) hosted by MaxCDN. Google and Microsoft host it as well.</p>
